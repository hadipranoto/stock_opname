## _Its an opname card monthly reports!_

1. Describe what you think happened that caused those bad reviews during our 12.12 event and why it happened. 
> The bad review comes because the app allowing user to pay but they get nothing eventually. An app should allow user to pay only and if only the product available to be purchased. 
2. Based on your analysis, propose a solution that will prevent the incidents from occurring again. 
> Because tha main issue here is "inventory quantities are often misreported", So Im proposing stock-opname method that are usually used by accountacy major. Im not gonna talk about how we prevent user from paying unavailable products, besides making a quarter month report that will decide how much stock will be displayed on the app before the 12.12 flash sale is coming up.
